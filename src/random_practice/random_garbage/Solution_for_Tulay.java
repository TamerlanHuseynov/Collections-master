/*
 * Instructions:
 *
 * 1) Use the Java programming language.
 * 2) Please use this CoderPad editor to code your solution. Code written
 *    outside CoderPadâ€™s editor and copy/pasted into CoderPad will not be
 *    accepted.
 * 3) Please write "production quality" code. Imagine that after you have
 *    written this code it will be submitted to one of your peers for code
 *    review. Your code should compile/execute without warnings/errors.
 * 4) Once you have completed the below Acceptance Criteria, simply close
 *    this tab and inform your point-of-contact that you are done.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria:
 *
 * 1) Write a function that accepts an array/list of strings, counts the
 *    occurrence of each string, and then returns a data structure with
 *    each unique string and the number of times it occurred. For example,
 *    given an input that contains:
 *
 *        ["apple", "bat", "apple", "car"]
 *
 *    the function should return a data structure that has a count of 2 for
 *    "apple", 1 for "bat", and 1 for "car".
 *
 *    Notes:
 *
 *      a) Your solution should ignore differences in upper/lowercase:
 *         "Apple" should be treated as "apple"
 *      b) Your solution should trim/strip/remove all
 *         leading/trailing/inner whitespace: " app le " should be treated
 *         as "apple"
 *      c) Your solution should trim/strip/remove any non-alphanumeric
 *         characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9): "apple!" should be treated as
 *         "apple"
 *
 * 2) Write the unit test coverage for your solution. Cover the
 *    permutations that ensure positive/negative functionality is correct.
 *    As well, cover meaningful edge cases to ensure both correct
 *    functionality and to ensure no errors with code execution.
 *    Note: For test coverage, feel free to just use assertion statements.
 *    However, if you're more comfortable using a testing library, that is
 *    acceptable too.
 * 3) At the top of your function/solution, document as a comment the big O
 *    run time of your solution.

        2) cover edge cases: what if you pass:
            - null array
            - null as a value of an individual String
            - numeric String
            - only white spaces
